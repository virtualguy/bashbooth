Prior warning, all code was written between the hours of 1 and 5am the night before so the whole thing is a bit of a giant hack...use at your own risk :)


Searched for ages and couldn't find anything opensource/free that would run a tethered camera take 3-5 photos and print it out as a photo strip. Optionally (ideally) it would also upload the photos to an album on Facebook.

An extended feature is to print out the photo strip on a receipt printer with a link to the upload (fast, lo-fi and cheap).

Some searching did show up some bash scripts that invoke gphoto and imagemagick. Then rely on dropbox and ifttt.com to do the facebook integration. Pretty cool stuff. There is also a very basic php page that has a button (touchscreen computer) to start things off. Optionally this could be a tablet/iphone as it is simply a webpage!
